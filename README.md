Doesn't seem to matter what I do<br />
I'm always number two<br />
No one knows how hard I tried, oh-oh, I<br />
I have feelings that I can't explain<br />
They're drivin' me insane<br />
All my life been so polite<br />
But I'll sleep alone tonight<br />
<br />
'Cause I'm just Ken<br />
Anywhere else, I'd be a ten<br />
Is it my destiny to live and die<br />
A life of blond fragility?<br />
I'm just Ken<br />
Where I see love, she sees a friend<br />
What will it take for her to see<br />
The man behind the tan and fight for me?<br />
<br />
I wanna know what's it's like to love<br />
To be the real thing<br />
Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?<br />
And is my moment finally here or am I dreaming?<br />
I'm no dreamer<br />
<br />
I'm just Ken (and I'm enough)<br />
And I'm great at doing stuff<br />
So, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken<br />
My name's Ken (and so am I)<br />
Put that manly hand in mine<br />
So, hey world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken<br />
Baby, I'm just Ken<br />
